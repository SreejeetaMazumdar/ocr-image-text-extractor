iv. Standard Time

*To avoid difficulties a system of standard time is observed
by all countries. Most countries adopt their standard time
from the central meridian of the countries. *There is a general
understanding among the countries of the world to select
the standard meridian in multiples of 7°30' of longitude.
That is why 82°30'E has been selected as the Standard
Meridian of India. This meridian passes through the Mirzapur
district (near Allahabad now Prayagraj) in the state of UP.
*Indian Standard Time is § hours and 30 minutes ahead of
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

Indian Standard Time Meridian

Indian standard Meridian passes through total 5 states which
are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and
Andhra Pradesh. *There are total 360 longitudes. All these
longitudes divide the earth into two equal parts and therefore

ahead of G.M.T. till he reaches the 180°E meridian) while

moving westward he loses 12 hours when he reaches 180° W.
There is thus a total difference of 24 hours on the two sides
of 180° meridian. Thus the date changes exactly by one day
crossing the International Date Line. It is curved from the
normal 180° meridian at the Bering Strait, Fiji, Tonga and
other islands to prevent confusion of date.

When there is midnight at IST meridian, a place
observes 6 A.M. The meridian on which the said place
is located is
(a) 73V'E
(c) 7°30°E

(b) 172°30°E
(d) 127° 30° W

Ans. (b)

When there is midnight at IST meridian, a place observes
6:00 A.M. has to be in the east of India. It is because Sun
rises early in the east. The difference in their meridian after
6 hours will be 15 x 6 = 90° (15° = 1 hour). Indian Standard
Time (IST) is the time observed throughout India and is
1°
calculated based on the °2 ‘9 East longitude. Thus, the
1°

place is situated at = 90° + 2 = 172° 30' East.

How many hours of time difference will be there
between the most western village of Gujrat and the
most eastern village of Arunachal Pradesh, Walong ?
(a) | hour (b) 2 hour
(c) 3 hour (d) 1/2 hour

Ans. (b)

The state of Gujarat is situated on the west coast of India
between 68° 4' east and 74°4' East longitudes and Arunachal
Pradesh is located between 91° 30’ East and 97° 30' East
longitudes. Thus, the longitudinal difference between western
village of Gujarat and eastern village of Arunachal Pradesh is
97°30! — 68°4' = 29°26’ . As we know from one longitude to
